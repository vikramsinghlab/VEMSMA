# VEMSMA

Voting ensemble learning based prediction of microRNA â€“ small molecule associations

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was performed, with a cumulative variance of 95% to minimize the number of dimensions for further analysis

Model generation
Voting fusion algorithm was used to develop hard and soft voting models, using five classification models, namely, SVM, RF, ANN, KNN, NB.
